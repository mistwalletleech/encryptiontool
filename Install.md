Prerequisites: Botan, Qt, Qt Creator, libargon2

Instructions:
1. Download files
2. Adjust path to Botan files in .pro file if needed
3. Open .pro file in Qt creator and compile (alternatively, run "qmake6 encrpytiontool.pro && make")

To install Qt on Windows using the installer, you need a Qt account. If you do not want to create a Qt account, you will need to build Qt from source. This is relatively more involved.
