Prerequisites: Botan, Qt, Qt Creator

Instructions:
1. Download zip and extract to folder
2. Open .pro file in Qt Creator
3. Adjust the path to the Botan files in the .pro files if needed.
4. Compile

To install Qt on Windows using the installer, you need a Qt account. If you do not want to create a Qt account, you will need to build Qt from source. This is relatively more involved.
